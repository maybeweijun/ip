Improve code quality

Currently there are some methods that are longer than 30 lines

This will heavily affect the readability of the code

Methods longer than 30 LoC has been changed where possible

This has been achieved by breaking up code into more short methods

Some methods are not possible to make shorter such as load and save
methods, will try to improve where possible
